python-template
=======================

A GitHub repository template for Python projects, which includes configuration for various tools, including:

- `Black`_
- `Flake8`_
- `isort`_
- `Hound`_

isort and flake8 are configured to be compatible with Black formatting standards.

The ``.gitignore`` is configured for Python, based on the ``.gitignore`` `template on GitHub <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Python.gitignore>`__, plus additional rules ignoring VS Code and IntelliJ IDEA project-specific configuration directories.

An MIT License template can be found in ``LICENSE``, which is **not the license** for this template.

Things for you to do
--------------------

- Edit **this document**, so it describes your project, and not this template.
- Edit ``requirements.txt``, where you should detail the package requirements for your project.
